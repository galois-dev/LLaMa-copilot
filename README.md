# LLaMA-copilot
 Are you tired of using github copilot. Does the convenience of it all detract from the end result? Do you also have a laptop with a hilarious amount of VRAM and therefore have a need to run copilot while you have no access to stable internet? Well you're in luck, this project is the solution to all your needs.
